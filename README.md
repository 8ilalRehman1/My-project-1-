This is my READ ME for the game. 
The game is in 2022.3.9f1 unity version. 
I have been using the Shader Lab to program the different shaders.
The project template is the 3D Built-in render pipeline
I used this pipeline as I think this is the most efficient pipeline
If they are any github issues with this project here is a link for the unity zipped project

FOR BUMP MAPPING AND NORMAL MAPPING I USED THE IMAGES PROVIDED BY https://3dtextures.me/ BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GREYSCALE IMAGE
IMAGES USED FROM https://3dtextures.me/ ARE THE BRICKS AND ROOF ON THE HOUSES
FOR BACKGROUND IMAGE I GOT IT FROM https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/345 BECAUSE I CANNOT MAKE A GOOD LOOKING IMAGE OF A CITY
USED ON THE WALLS
FOR THE FLOOR I USED A GRASS IMAGE FROM https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/abstract-green-background-with-vintage-grunge-background-texture-green-paper_25202238.htm BECAUSE I WANTED SOMETHING LOW RES 
I WANTED SOMETHING LOW RES BECAUSE MY PROJECT WAS TOO BIG FRO GIT HUB.
