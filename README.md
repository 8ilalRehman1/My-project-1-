This is my READ ME for the game. 
The game is in 2022.3.9f1 unity version. 
I have been using the Shader Lab to program the different shaders.
The project template is the 3D Built-in render pipeline
I used this pipeline as I think this is the most efficient pipeline
If they are any github issues with this project here is a link for the unity zipped project
